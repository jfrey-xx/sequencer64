 *
 *  This module defines the base class for the performance of MIDI patterns.
 *
 * \library       sequencer64 application
 * \author        Seq24 team; modifications by Chris Ahlstrom and Tim Deagan

 *
 *  This class is probably the single most important class in Sequencer64, as
 *  it supports sequences, playback, JACK, and more.
 *
 * Requests for more MIDI control:
 *
 *  "On a rather selfish note, I'd love to be able to send these mods from my
 *  shiny new (AKAI APC MINI) control surface:
 *
 *      - Arm for Recording
 *      - Solo On (compare it to the Replace functionality)
 *      - Solo Off
 *
 *  "Solo might not even be necessary as we have Replace. It would make sense
 *  if it allowed a temporary solo which could then be released and the
 *  original state would return. I don't exactly know how this would work,
 *  however."
 *
 *  "A MIDI mod to toggle the recording of incoming MIDI data would be an
 *  amazing step toward not having to touch the mouse. I guess a mod for MIDI
 *  pass through would also be required?"
 *
 *  "And then, actually, Start/Stop via MIDI would be something very
 *  valuable."
 *
 *  "Waiting OSC avaibility, I use
 *  https://github.com/Excds/seq24-launchpad-mapper for my Launchpad Mini."
 *
 *  Summarizing these state-saving buffers:
 *
 *      -   m_armed_statuses[c_max_sequence].
 *          Used in perform::toggle_playing_tracks(), a feature copped from
 *          the Seq32 project. Flagged by m_armed_saved.
 *      -   m_seqs_active[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Indicates if a pattern has any data in it, i.e. it is not empty,
 *          whether it is muted or not.
 *      -   m_was_active_main[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Used in perform::is_dirty_main().
 *      -   m_was_active_edit[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Used in perform::is_dirty_edit().
 *      -   m_was_active_perf[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Used in perform::is_dirty_perf().
 *      -   m_was_active_names[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Used in perform::is_dirty_names().
 *      -   m_sequence_state[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Used in unsetting the snapshot status (c_status_snapshot).
 *          perform::save_playing_state() uses this to preserve the playing
 *          status.
 *      -   m_screenset_state[m_seqs_in_set].
 *          Holds the state of playing in the current screen-set, to determine
 *          which patterns follow the queued-replace (queued-solo) feature,
 *
 *  m_playscreen.  In seq24, this value (called m_playing_screen) is used for
 *
 *      -   select_group_mute(), to get the sequence/pattern offset for
 *          copying the pattern playing status into the mute-group array.
 *      -   select_mute_group(), very similar.  In sequencer64, this is
 *          called set_and_copy_mute_group() to avoid confusion.
 *          Also, tdeagan's code swaps m_screenset for this value.
 *      -   mute_group_tracks(), to implement the mute-group operation.
 *          Also, tdeagan's code swaps m_screenset for this value.
 *      -   sequence_playing_on()/_off().  If this value equals
 *          m_screenset and the sequence is within the playing screen,
 *          then its mute state is set to true/false (on/off).
 *      -   set_playing_screenset(), where this value is set to
 *          m_screenset.  This function is called when
 *          -   c_midi_control_play_ss is performed.
 *          -   The main window hot-key for screen-set is pressed.
 *
 *  m_screenset.  In seq24, this value (called m_screen_set) is used for
 *
 *      -   In set_screenset().  The value is clipped to 0 to 31.
 *      -   set_playing_screenset(), as noted above.
 *      -   sequence_playing_on()/_off(), as noted above.
 *
 *  set_playing_screenset().  This function is called when
 *
 *      -   c_midi_control_play_ss is performed.
 *      -   The main window hot-key for screen-set is pressed.
 *
 *      I think we may need to call this after calling set_screenset(seq),
 *      where a number is available.
 *
 *  set_screenset().  This function is called
 *
 *      -   In decrement_ and increment_screenset().
 *
 *      In mainwnd::timer_callback(), the mainwid screen-set is set to match
 *      the new value, which can be altered by the screen-set up and down
 *      hot-keys.
 *
 *  User jean-emmanuel added a new MIDI control for setting the screen-set
 *  directly by number.
 *
 * TODO: seq32's tick_to_jack_frame () etc. for tempo.
 *
 * MIDI CLOCK Support:
 *
 *    On output:
 *
 *        perform::m_usemidiclock starts at false;
 *        It is set to false in pause_playing();
 *        It is set to the midiclock parameter of inner_stop();
 *        If m_usemidiclock is true:
 *            It affects m_midiclocktick in output;
 *            The position in output cannot be repositioned;
 *            The tick location cannot be changed;
 *
 *    On input:
 *
 *    -   If MIDI Start is received, m_midiclockrunning and m_usemidiclock
 *        become true, and m_midiclocktick and m_midiclockpos become 0.
 *    -   If MIDI Continue is received, m_midiclockrunning is set to true and
 *        we start according to song-mode.
 *    -   If MIDI Stop is received, m_midiclockrunning is set to false,
 *        m_midiclockpos is set to the current tick (!), all_notes_off(), and
 *        inner_stop(true) [sets m_usemidiclock = true].
 *    -   If MIDI Clock is received, and m_midiclockrunning is true, then
 *        m_midiclocktick += 24 [SEQ64_MIDI_CLOCK_INCREMENT];
 *    -   If MIDI Song Position is received, then m_midiclockpos is set as per
 *        in data in this event.
 *    -   MIDI Active Sense and MIDI Reset are currently filtered by the JACK
 *        implementation.

 *
 *  Currently, when reading the MIDI file, the beats/minute value is obtained

 *  This setting is now also made for the two Time Signature values.

 *
 *  For output, both apps have always connected to all ports automatically.
 *  But we want to support disabling some output ports, both in the "rc"

 *
 * Stazed:
 *
 *      This function's sole purpose was to prevent inner_stop() from being
 *      called internally when JACK was running... potentially twice.
 *      inner_stop() was called by output_func() when JACK sent a
 *      JackTransportStopped message. If seq42 initiated the stop, then
 *      stop_jack() was called which then triggered the JackTransportStopped
 *      message to output_func() which then triggered the bool stop_jack to
 *      call inner_stop().  The output_func() call to inner_stop() is only
 *      necessary when some other JACK client sends a jack_transport_stop
 *      message to JACK, not when it is initiated by seq42.  The method of
 *      relying on JACK to call inner_stop() when internally initiated caused
 *      a (very) obscure apparent freeze if you press and hold the start/stop
 *      key if set to toggle. This occurs because of the delay between
 *      JackTransportStarting and JackTransportStopped if both triggered in
 *      rapid succession by holding the toggle key down.  The variable
 *      global_is_running gets set false by a delayed inner_stop() from JACK
 *      after the start (true) is already sent. This means the global is set
 *      to true when JACK is actually off (false). Any subsequent presses to
 *      the toggle key send a stop message because the global is set to true.
 *      Because JACK is not running, output_func() is not running to send the
 *      inner_stop() call which resets the global to false. Thus an apparent
 *      freeze as the toggle key endlessly sends a stop, but inner_stop()
 *      never gets called to reset. Whoo! So, to fix this we just need to
 *      call inner_stop() directly rather than wait for JACK to send a
 *      delayed stop, only when running. This makes the whole purpose of this
 *      stop() function unneeded. The check for m_jack_running is commented
 *      out and this function could be removed. It is being left for future

/**
 *  This function is called by input_thread_func().  It handles certain MIDI
 *  input events.
 *
 * Stazed:
 *
 *      http://www.blitter.com/~russtopia/MIDI/~jglatt/tech/midispec/ssp.htm
 *
 *      Example: If a Song Position value of 8 is received, then a sequencer
 *      (or drum box) should cue playback to the third quarter note of the
 *      song.  (8 MIDI beats * 6 MIDI clocks per MIDI beat = 48 MIDI Clocks.
 *      Since there are 24 MIDI Clocks in a quarter note, the first quarter
 *      occurs on a time of 0 MIDI Clocks, the second quarter note occurs upon
 *      the 24th MIDI Clock, and the third quarter note occurs on the 48th
 *      MIDI Clock).
 *
 *      8 MIDI beats * 6 MIDI clocks per MIDI beat = 48 MIDI Clocks.
 *
 * EVENT_MIDI_START:
 *
 *      Starts the MIDI Time Clock.  Kepler34 does "stop();
 *      set_playback_mode(false); start();" in its version of this event.
 *      This sets the playback mode to Live mode. This behavior seems
 *      reasonable, though function names Sequencer64 uses are different.
 *
 * EVENT_MIDI_CONTINUE:
 *
 *      MIDI continue: start from current position.  This is sent immediately
 *      after EVENT_MIDI_SONG_POS, and is used for starting from other than
 *      beginning of the song, or for starting from previous location at
 *      EVENT_MIDI_STOP. Again, converted to Kepler34 mode of setting the
 *      playback mode to Live mode.
 *
 * EVENT_MIDI_STOP:
 *
 *      Do nothing, just let the system pause.  Since we're not getting ticks
 *      after the stop, the song won't advance when start is received, we'll
 *      reset the position. Or, when continue is received, we won't reset the
 *      position.  We do an inner_stop(); the m_midiclockpos member holds the
 *      stop position in case the next event is "continue".  This feature is
 *      not in Kepler34.
 *
 * EVENT_MIDI_CLOCK:
 *
 *      MIDI beat clock (MIDI timing clock or simply MIDI clock) is a clock
 *      signal broadcast via MIDI to ensure that MIDI-enabled devices stay in
 *      synchronization. It is not MIDI timecode.  Unlike MIDI timecode, MIDI
 *      beat clock is tempo-dependent. Clock events are sent at a rate of 24
 *      ppqn (pulses per quarter note). Those pulses maintain a synchronized
 *      tempo for synthesizers that have BPM-dependent voices and for
 *      arpeggiator synchronization.  Location information can be specified
 *      using MIDI Song Position Pointer.  Many simple MIDI devices ignore
 *      this message.
 *
 * EVENT_MIDI_SONG_POS:
 *
 *      MIDI song position pointer message tells a MIDI device to cue to a
 *      point in the MIDI sequence to be ready to play.  This message consists
 *      of three bytes of data. The first byte, the status byte, is 0xF2 to
 *      flag a song position pointer message. Two bytes follow the status
 *      byte.  These two bytes are combined in a 14-bit value to show the
 *      position in the song to cue to. The top bit of each of the two bytes
 *      is not used.  Thus, the value of the position to cue to is between
 *      0x0000 and 0x3FFF. The position represents the MIDI beat, where a
 *      sequence always starts on beat zero and each beat is a 16th note.
 *      Thus, the device will cue to a specific 16th note.  Also see the
 *      combine_bytes() function.
 *
 * EVENT_MIDI_SYSEX:
 *
 *      These messages are system-wide messages.  We filter system-wide
 *      messages.  If the master MIDI buss is dumping, set the timestamp of
 *      the event and stream it on the sequence.  Otherwise, use the event
 *      data to control the sequencer, if it is valid for that action.
 *
 *      "Dumping" is set when a seqedit window is open and the user has
 *      clicked the "record MIDI" or "thru MIDI" button.  In this case, if the
 *      seq32 support is in force, dump to it, else stream the event, with
 *      possibly multiple sequences set.  Otherwise, handle an incoming MIDI
 *      control event.
 *
 *      Also available (but macroed out) is Stazed's parse_sysex() function.
 *      It seems specific to certain Yamaha devices, but might prove useful
 *      later.
 *
 *  For events less than or equal to SysEx, we call midi_control_event()
 *  to handle the MIDI controls that Sequencer64 supports.  (These are
 *  configurable in the "rc" configuration file.)
