 *
 *  This module defines a number of constants relating to control of the 32
 *  sequences in a set, plus additional controls that shipped with seq24, plus
 *  new controls to help make Sequencer64 controllable without a graphical
 *  user interface.
 *
 *  User jean-emmanuel added a new MIDI control for setting the screen-set
 *  directly by number.

/**
 *  Pseudo control values for associating MIDI events (I think) with
 *  automation of some of the controls in seq24.  The lowest value is
 *  c_seqs_in_set * 2 = 64.
 *
 *  I think the reason for that value is to perhaps handle two sets or
 *  something like that.  Will figure it out later.
 *
 *  The controls are read in from the "rc" configuration files, and are
 *  written to the c_midictrl section of the "proprietary" final track in a
 *  Seq24/Sequencer64 MIDI file.
 *
 *  Note that we are adding some more MIDI control entries to support the
 *  following additional functions:
 *
 *      -   Start
 *      -   Pause
 *      -   Stop
 *      -   (any more???)
 *
 *  To help with backward compatibility, the old c_midi_controls limit is
 *  supplemented with a new, higher limit, c_midi_controls_extended.
 *  We also add a number of placeholders so we don't have to adjust the new
 *  limit again later.  To aid the transition, g_midi_control_limit replaces
 *  c_midi_controls, though, for now, it has the same value.

/**
 *  This class (formerly a struct) contains the control information for
 *  sequences that make up a live set.
 *
 *  Note that, although we've converted this to a full-fledged class, the
 *  ordering of variables and the data arrays used to fill them is very
 *  signifcant.  See the midifile and optionsfile modules.
 *
 *  The perform module sets up the three following arrays for each of the MIDI
 *  controls that can be defined in the "rc" file:
 *
\verbatim
    m_midi_cc_toggle[]
    m_midi_cc_on[]
    m_midi_cc_off[]
\endverbatim
 *
 *  These three arrays are specified in the "rc" by a line like the following:
 *
\verbatim
    n [0 0   0   0   0   0] [0 0   0   0   0   0] [0 0   0   0   0   0]
\endverbatim
 *
 *  where n ranges from 0 to 73 or 83.  Lines 0 to 31 provide controller
 *  values for the "pattern group", one line for each of the 32 pattern slots.
 *  Lines 32 to 63 provide controller values for the "mute in group", one line
 *  for each of the 32 pattern slots.  The rest of the lines provide entries
 *  for control of: BPM up, BPM down, Screen-set up, Screen-set down, Mod
 *  Replaces, Mod Snapshot, Mod Queue, Mod gmute (group mute), Mod glearn
 *  (group learn), and Screen-set Play.  Additional controls are currently in
 *  the works.
 *
 *  In each of the bracketed sections, the values correspond to the members in
 *  this order: m_active, m_inverse_active, m_status, m_data, m_min_value, and
 *  m_max_value.
 *
 *  Why are the status, data, and min/max values long?  A character or
 *  midibyte would be enough.  We'll fix that later, once we have tested this
 *  stuff.  We do need to convert them from long to int, though, and do that
 *  in the scanning and output done by optionsfile.
