/**
 * \file          perform.hpp
 *
 *  This module declares/defines the base class for handling many facets
 *  of performing (playing) a full MIDI song.
 *
 * \library       sequencer64 application
 * \author        Seq24 team; modifications by Chris Ahlstrom
 * \date          2015-07-24
 * \updates       2018-05-12
 * \license       GNU GPLv2 or above
 *
 *  This class still has way too many members, even with the JACK and
 *  key-binding support moved to separate modules.  Items that could
 *  profitably be partitioned into separate modules are:
 *
 *      -   Mute-group support.
 *      -   MIDI control support.
 *      -   The remaining portions of trigger support.
 *      -   Sequence array parameters could be usefully combined into
 *          an array of structures.
 *
 *  Important global MIDI parameters:
 *
 *      -   m_master_bus
 *      -   m_beats_per_bar
 *      -   m_beat_width
 *      -   m_tempo_track_number
 *
 *  User jean-emmanuel added a new MIDI control for setting the screen-set
 *  directly by number.  To handle this, a value parameter was added to
 *  handle_midi_control_ex().
